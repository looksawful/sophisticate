# How to report issues and request features

## Quick workflow for production beta

### When you find a problem

1. **Create an Issue** → Choose **"Bug report"** template
2. **Fill fields**: what happened, steps to reproduce, environment
3. **Add label**: `priority:high/medium/low` + area (e.g., `crop`, `queue`, `export`)
4. **Leave as-is** → Backlog (triage happens weekly)

### When you have an improvement idea

1. **Create an Issue** → Choose **"Improvement"** template
2. **Fill fields**: current problem, proposed change, benefit
3. **Add label**: `priority:X`, area tag
4. **Project**: Add to Backlog

### When requesting new feature

1. **Create an Issue** → Choose **"Feature request"** template
2. **Fill fields**: goal, description, acceptance criteria
3. **Add label**: `enhancement`, priority, area
4. **Project**: Add to Backlog

## Labels to use

**Priority** (pick one):

- `priority:high` — breaks workflow, users stuck
- `priority:medium` — slows down but workaround exists
- `priority:low` — nice-to-have, cosmetic

**Area** (can combine):

- `crop` — crop/resize features
- `queue` — multi-video, merge functionality
- `merge` — video merging/output
- `ui` — interface, controls, layout
- `perf` — performance, optimization
- `docs` — documentation, guides

**Type** (auto-assigned):

- `bug` — defect report
- `enhancement` — improvement or feature
- `triage` — needs review

## Templates are located at

`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` → choose based on issue type.
